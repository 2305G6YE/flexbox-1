<h1>Interneting is hard: Flexbox</h1>

<h3>Overview (15th April 2025)</h3>
<p> I will be attempting to recreate a website following the instructions of a website called "Interneting is Hard" regarding Flexbox usage.</p>

<h3>Motivations and Goals</h3>
<p>After completing basic HTML and CSS practice by creating a recipe website (you can see it under "odin-recipes" in my public repositories), I am moving on to the later part of the curriculum. This section involves me learning Flexbox and using it as a major part of structuring my website into a more modern look. I hope to implement it into my recipe website at the end of this section.

<h3>Takeaways (16th April 2025)</h3>
<p>I learnt basic commands on how to convert a block element into a flex, aligning vertically and horizontally, and reversing the order of the flex-items. I also learnt how to target individual elements inside the flex-container using order and align-self. The biggest takeaway for me is remembering to close my div elements, and remembering that when in columns, the alignment commands are swapped.</p>
